			"With this project it was challenging to get the API working since I was fairly new to asynchronous Javascript. I used OpenWeatherMap's free Weather API and had to spend a good amount of time looking through the documentation to figure out specifically how it works. Once I sifted through documentation, I eventually got it working.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"The main thing I learned from this project is how important documentation is to read & understand. In this project I also learned how to use the built-in javascript map prototype method to create & return an array of components, each representing a weather day of the week.",

			"With this project I was fairly new to Javascript and wanted to learn something I had frequently seen on websites. This project was challenging for me since I was pretty new to CSS. I also grew a deeper understanding of setInterval so the carousel transitions through images every few seconds.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"A key point I learned from this project was that using built-in Javascript methods made my code a lot nicer and easier to read & digest. This project was one of the first projects where I had to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to query the DOM. I now understand the importance of using them, as they are just shortcuts to common programming tasks. I also learned that if I'm struggling with a specific issue, there are a lot of online resources & smart people out there that that I can refer to.",

			"This was one of the first multi-page web apps I made with React. One of the challenges here was using React Router to route to different components with React. I was also challenged with some of the CSS I wanted like the full image as the background. One feature I really wanted to do was a flip card affect. This proved to be one of the hardest parts of the project but once I got it working I was very pleased with it.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned in this project how to use React Router to switch between components based on URL routes which I ended up using in my later React projects. This project also introduced me to custom hooks. Up to this point, I was mainly using the useState and useEffect hooks, but this project introduced the useNavigation hook to route between components. I also learned that there are a lot of CSS effects that are already out there to use, and you do not have to make them yourself from scratch. I had found the CSS flip card effect online and was able to use it and edit it to my liking.",

		challenges:
			"Prior to this project, I had created a basic Mortgage Calculator, but this time I decided to take on the challenge to create something similar with React. A big challenge to this project was learning about React's component lifecycle and how components re-render on state change. I ran into many errors and infinite render loops which eventually led to a better understandin of React component lifecycles. I also learned a lot about passing down props to components and how that entire lifecycle works as well.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned how to structure components in a project and organize them all in a larger project. Learned how to use state more and passing state down to other components as props. This project helped me a lot put all the pieces of React together into a project and really see the benefits of using React and state over just querying the DOM directly with vanilla Javascript.",

I was still really new and learning and so learning how to write functions to grab text input data and compute formulas to calculate was all pretty new. A big challenge with this project was querying and manipulating the DOM to add and update DOM elements",

It was difficult to make the flow of the game, determine winners, and create the computer playing. This project pushed me a lot when working on it to learn how to use methods, objects, arrays, and validation. This project challenged everything I had learned from previous and much more.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned the importance of keeping functions simple, and not stuffing too much logic into a single function. I seperated business logic into smaller functions and composed them together, which led to more readable & understandable code.",

It was a struggle at the start to understand how Javascript deals with asyncronous code, and challenged me to use async/await to grab data from OpenWeatherMap's public API.",
