			"With this project it was hard to get the API working and for me to use the data once I got the API working. I used a free weather API and had to spend a good amount of time looking through the website on how it works. To get the weather icons working took some time researching into the documentation.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned really well that when you are using a framework or an API that what you need is probably in the documentation and you need research to learn it. Once you do that you will understand it much more and be able to use it effectively. In this project I also learned how to use the Map method to create each day in the week to all be the same but with different data.",

		challenges:
			"With this project I was fairly new at Javascript and wanted to learn something I had frequently seen on websites. This project was hard for me for being new and not understanding some css properties to not display all images expect the current one. I also had a hard time before I learned setInterval.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"What I learned from this project was that with the help of using methods in JavaScript it can make functions and solutions to issues so much easier. I now love using methods and understand the importance of using them. I also learned that if you are struggling with an issue, there are a lot of smarter people out there who can and maybe already have helped with that code issue and you can learn from them.",

		challenges:
			"This was one of the first multi page websites I made with React and being so made me face some challenges. One of these was having to learn and use React Router to route to different pages with React. I also had an issue with some of the CSS I wanted like the full image as the background. One feature I really wanted to do was a flip card, this proved to be one of the hardest parts of the project but once I got it working I was very pleased with it.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned in this project how to use React Router which I have used many more times. I also learned that there are a lot of CSS effects that are already out there to use, and you do not have to make them yourself from scratch. I had found the CSS flip card effect online and was able to use it and edit it to my styling.",

		challenges:
			"In this project I had made a calculator before, but this time I was making it with React and using state. A big challenge to this project was learning multiple state changes and learning how the render lifecycle was working. I had a lot of errors happen when I would have the project constantly re-rendering or not working properly. I also had to learn how to use state props and deal with multiple components all working together.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned how to have multiple components in a project and organize them all in a larger project. Learned how to use state more and passing state down to other components as props. This project helped me a lot put all the pieces of React together into a project and really see the benefits of using React and state.",

		challenges:
			"With this mortgage calculator I decided to do this project because I was working in the mortgage industry and it seemed like a fun one to learn. I was still really new and learning and so learning how to write functions to grab input data and compute formulas to calculate was all new. It was difficult to learn how to write formulas in javascript and calculate data and then return that to the HTML tags.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned how to use DOM manipulation in JavaScript and to write functions with math equations to compute data. I also learned how to use if statements for validation in the functions, as if there was an input not filled out to show an error about it.",

It was difficult to make the flow of the game, determine winners, and create the computer playing. This project pushed me a lot when working on it to learn how to use methods, objects and arrays, and validation. This was one project that required everything I had learned and much more.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned how to complete many functions and updates in a specific and needed order. If some items happened before others in a game environment then it would break the game. I learned that order matters. I learned how to use methods and DOM manipulation together. If I had to do it again I would try to make the game with React and use state for all the changes.",

		challenges:
			"This project helped me to learn async and await, I did not know promises but this helped me to learn. It was a struggle at the start to understand promises and to use async to grab data.",
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned async await, how to use higher order functions, and use multiple methods together to manipulate data in the way it is needed. I had to use multiple array methods to grab my data and to create it in the format needed to display the times of locations selected.",
