			'My biggest challenge with creating this project was learning how to use Test Driven Development and learning how to code tests. Learning how to code tests before writing any project code was very different for me and hard to grasp my head around at first. Knowing how you want your application to work before writing code I now see is very important. I also had a challenge with learning serverless functions with AWS Lambda. Having AWS perform as my server is very convenient and nice to use once set up. There is a learning curve for serverless functions or cloud computing but I hope to get better at it moving forward.',
		knowledgeLearned:
			"I learned through creating this project what is involved in writing tests for applications using a Test Driven Development technique or TDD. This involved learning how to write and use Reacts testing library to be able to write and use tests for React. I have learned the importance of writing and having tests for your applications and having the different types of tests involved (Unit, Integration and End to End tests). Next was learning how to use AWS Lambda functions to have a serverless backend. Through this method I was able to have AWS be my apps backend and make the server easy to use. I know I have a lot to learn about AWS or serverless technologies but this was a great start at becoming introduced into it. Next was learning Object Oriented Programming techniques. I learned how React used to be written with Class components and how that's different from how we use functional components and how functional components better fit into how Javascript operates. To finish it off I learned about Progressive Web Apps and how they compare and differ from regular web apps and native apps. I then learned how to implement progressive functionality into my built app so it could be used offline. ",

			'This project was one of the hardest challenges I have faced in a long time. I first learned React and thought that Angular would be similar and I might be able to learn it with ease due to that but I was very wrong. Angular just felt so different and difficult to me. I understand its a framework and so it has similar features to React like Components and keeping sections of your app on their own and then rendering them together. To get this project working and learn the basics of Angular I had to invest a lot more time in reading the docs and learning from others on youtube explaining things in different ways. By the end of the project I started to understand it better but to get it more fully I would need to invest a lot more time into it I feel.',

Using React Native did make it easier as I already know React but still it was different due to having different native methods and functionality. Project used Google's Firebase as well for storage which was a little difficult to implement and learn. Overall learning Google's Firebase was probably the hardest part of this project.",

			'There were a lot of challenging moments when creating this app due to it being the first full project done with the MERN stack. Learning and building the database with Mongo was pretty hard to do and took some time to complete. Once it was done I created a backend API with express to make requests to the database. This was also a first for me and in doing so it was hard to get the API to work with all requests, and introduce authentication measures such as CORS and Passport. Getting the authentication measures to work and understanding how they work was a huge challenge. There were some front end challenges as well but most of the main challenges came from inexperience with back end technologies and how they function.',
